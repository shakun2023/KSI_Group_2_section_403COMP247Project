Both the police department and the “general public” would make use of a software product that can give them an idea about the likelihood of fatal collisions that involve loss of life. For the police department it would assist them in taking better measures of security and better planning for road conditions around certain neighborhoods. For the public individuals, it would help them assess the need for additional precautions at certain times and weather conditions and neighborhoods

Police want:
    better measures of security
    better planning for road conditions around certain neighborhoods
Public Individuals want:
    assess the need for additional precautions at certain
        times
        weather conditions
        neighborhoods

Although it could be assumed that the columns with high amounts of missing data are empty because 
that the answer is no to that condition meaning that condition was present in the accident, it impossible to know if the empty data is an answer of "No" or if it is actually missing data. 
the safest decision is to drop those features because there is a high chance of incorrect data, some of the ones with very high percent of missing data could also represent outliers or factors that are not representative of common details that affect crashes.
Any column with more than 20% missing data is to be dropped because there is not enough data to accurately represent the population of the data.

"""

"""
NOTE
Still need to manually review the remaining variables and decide which to drop or keep
AND provide justification
"""
#######################
"""
Keep ACCLASS
ACCLASS is the target variable
it contains the following options
Fatal
Non-Fatal Injury
Property Damage O (combine with "Non-Fatal Injury" to create "Non-Fatal" option)
empty (drop this row)
"""
#######################
"""
Other Columns to Drop:
    
 drop these are just ID numbers for tracking that were generated after the crash
    OBJECTID
    INDEX
    ACCNUM


######################
Keep the following columns because they help to analyze respective collisions and their impact on accident severity.
CYCCOND
PEDESTRIAN
CYCLIST
Drop AUTOMOBILE (Driver Involved in Collission) because almost all accidents involve a driver; this feature is likely redundant. 
Keep MOTORCYCLE because it Important for analyzing patterns in motorcycle collissions and informing safety policies.
Keep TRUCK as it's useful for identifying accident hotspots involving large vehicles.
Keep TRSN_CITY_VEH because it's useful for identifying accident hotspots involving large vehicles.
Keep TRSN_CITY_VEH because Helps in analyzing whether collisions involving passengers tend to be more severe.
    
######################
NOTE: check for columns with too many unique variables 
SHOULD we drop all columns with too many unique variables?
decide on cutoff point for too many unique variables 
######################

 there are too many unique values, also the road names are easier representations of location
    LATITUDE
    LONGITUDE

 drop because these variables are not listed or explained in the KSI_Glossary
    x
    y 

 drop because is old version of new variables (HOOD_158 and NEIGHBOURHOOD_158)
    HOOD_140
    NEIGHBOURHOOD_140

 drop because duplicate info of HOOD_158 (HOOD_158 is unique id for NEIGHBOURHOOD_158 which is name of neighborhood)
    NEIGHBOURHOOD_158
